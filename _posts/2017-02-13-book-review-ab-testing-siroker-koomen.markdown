title: 'Book review: A/B Testing: The Most Powerful Way to Turn Clicks Into Customers'
date: 2017-02-14
author: Ruslan Ledesma-Garza
summary: 'I recommend this book as an introduction to A/B testing for
non-techincal people. If you are looking for theory and practice, you
may want to look at another book.'
---

The book is authored by Dan Siroker and Pete Koomen, founders of
A/B testing company Optimizely.
Despite their amount of technical experience, the first edition of the
book is an introduction to the non-technical aspects of A/B testing.

The book consists of a series of examples that may serve as point of
reference when you come up with your own ideas of what (not) to test,
how to introduce A/B testing into your organization and how to
implement it.

On the positive side, the book may be read in one sitting and may
serve the purpose of educating non-technical audiences about the
purpose and benefits of A/B testing.
The majority of the examples cover front-end features and are
therefore easy to understand.

On the negative side, the book will not give technical audiences any
actionable information.
The book does include an appendix that tries to explain point
estimates, interval estimates and test statistics.
However, the explanations are terse and the appendix spares the use of
examples.
